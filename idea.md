My project idea is 
EV Maintenance Assistant
Idea:
A chatbot that helps EV owners diagnose problems based on symptoms they describe.
Example: “My car battery drains too fast” → The bot generates possible causes and solutions.
AI Role: Uses a fine-tuned generative model trained on EV maintenance manuals.
